# Tech Test

The challenge is to create a file archive with both frontend and backend in preferred tech stack. 

## Code

For frontend I've used:
  * **React.js**
  * **JSX**
  * **ES6**
  * **Styled Components**
  * **React Router**
  * **SweetAlert**

## Reflection

In the frontend I've used the API I've created in backend to GET, POST and DELETE uploaded files. A user is able to write its name, a description and add a file that will be uploaded to Cloudinary. The posted content is visible in retrived in the list where you're able to see who uploaded what and are able to click the file to open. There's a delete button with validation before actually removing the content which comes from SweetAlert.

I put most of my focus on functionality to make sure everything worked the way I wanted it to. I'm satisfied with my work here but if time wasn't limited I would have loved to put some user-friendly design to it and explore with the .xml file type.
